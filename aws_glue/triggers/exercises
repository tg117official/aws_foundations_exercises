AWS Glue Trigger Exercises
Exercise 1: On-demand Trigger
Goal: Manually run a trigger that starts a single ETL job.


Steps:

Create a trigger named manual_trigger_job1.

Attach it to Job 1 (Raw → Curated).

Run the trigger manually from the console.

Learning: Students see how triggers can decouple starting a job from running it directly.



Exercise 2: Job-completion Trigger (chaining)
Goal: Start Job 2 (Curated → Fact) only after Job 1 succeeds.

Steps:

Create trigger job1_to_job2_trigger.

Type = Job-completion.

Condition = Job 1 succeeded.

Action = Start Job 2.

Learning: Introduces dependency-based chaining.



Exercise 3: Multiple downstream jobs
Goal: Run two jobs in parallel when Job 2 finishes.

Scenario: After fact table creation, we want both:

Job 3 → Aggregated Summaries

A separate Job → Data Quality Checks

Steps:

Create trigger job2_downstream_trigger.

Condition = Job 2 succeeded.

Actions = Start Job 3 and DQ Job.

Learning: Shows fan-out pattern (one job → multiple downstream).



Exercise 4: Scheduled Trigger
Goal: Automate pipeline runs daily at 1 AM IST.

Steps:

Create trigger daily_pipeline_trigger.

Type = Schedule.

Cron = cron(30 19 * * ? *) (1:00 AM IST = 19:30 UTC).
Attach to Job 1.

Learning: Introduces time-based scheduling with cron expressions.



Exercise 5: Conditional branching with Success/Failure
Goal: Show different triggers for success vs failure of a job.

Scenario:

If Job 3 succeeds → send data to reporting job.
If Job 3 fails → run an error-handling/notification job.

Steps:

Create trigger job3_success_trigger → condition: Job 3 success → action: Reporting Job.
Create trigger job3_failure_trigger → condition: Job 3 failed → action: Notify Job.

Learning: Teaches error handling pipelines with Glue triggers.
